    <h1>Prevent cheating in offline progress calculations</h1>
    <p>
      When a player exits, store the signed snapshot from <code>/secnow</code>. On return, validate that
      snapshot and compute progression based on trusted elapsed time instead of the client clock.
    </p>
    <h2>Flow</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Save signed timestamp at logout.</li>
      <li>On login, validate stored payload with <code>/validate</code>.</li>
      <li>Use current trusted timestamp from <code>/now</code> to compute elapsed time.</li>
      <li>Reject impossible progression jumps.</li>
    </ol>
